## Q1 Concepts of raster graphics (short answer)
	
### Q1.1 frame buffer

A frame buffer is part of the RAM (Random-Access Memory) in a computer which contains the graphics of a single image.
Since a graphics card has RAM, the frame buffer can be apart of either the RAM installed in the computer or the graphics card	

### Q1.2 pixel

A single dot when combined with other pixels creates an image. A screens resolution is dependent on the number of pixels
the screen has, the more pixels, the higher the resolution. 

### Q1.3 color depth

The color depth is the number of bits and when multiplied by the resolution is the frame buffer size.

### Q1.4 resolution

Resolution is the number of pixels. When referring to a montior, the maximum screen resolution is the number of pixels.
However one can decrease resolution.
 

## Q2 Concepts of raster display (short answer)
	
### Q2.1 scan line

A scan line is pixels lined in a row. When the number scan lines is multiplied by the number of pixels in the scan line
you get the resolution.

### Q2.2 refreshment & refresh rate

Refreshement and the refresh rate reffers to how often a new image is displayed per second (how many frames it can 
display within a second).

### Q2.3 frame

A frame is an single image which is displayed on the screen and fully scanned.


## Q3 Roles of CPU and GPU in CG (short answer)
	
### Q3.1 CPU roles

The CPU's role is to carry out instructions by the user and any model computing.

### Q3.2 GPU roles

The GPU's role is to increase the creation and rendering of any image or video.



## Q4 C/C++ OpenGL programming environment (lab practice)
	
### Q4.1 C/C++ OpenGL installation
 
Complete? (Yes/No) Yes

If Yes, insert a screen shot image to show the completion.

![image caption](images/demo.png){width=90%} cube.png teapot.png

If No,  Add a short description to describe the issues encountered.

### Q4.2 OpenGL C project
 
Complete? (Yes/No) Yes

If Yes, insert a screen shot image to show the completion.

![image caption](images/demo.png){width=90%} Kilgard.png

If No,  Add a short description to describe the issues encountered.

### Q4.3 OpenGL C++ project
 
Complete? (Yes/No) Yes

If Yes, insert a screen shot image to show the completion.

![image caption](images/demo.png){width=90%} glut.png

If No,  Add a short description to describe the issues encountered.
